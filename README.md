# CSec-LS-Digital-Forensics

Simulated a server between two people Alice and Bob using Socket Programming. Then used Wireshark to packet capture their network and obtain an encrypted message, in Brainfuck, which is an esoteric programming language. Decoded it using a simple Brainfuck interpretor implemented in Python to reveal the message.
